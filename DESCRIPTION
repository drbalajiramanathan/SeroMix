Description: Provides a robust, validated statistical tool to classify 
    individuals into "infected" and "uninfected" groups based on 
    serological titre data. This package is the result of a rigorous 
    development process that demonstrated that more complex longitudinal 
    models were not identifiable with the available data. The resulting 
    baseline model is fast, stable, and provides a crucial performance 
    benchmark for serological classification tasks.
